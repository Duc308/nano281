# NANO281 - Data Science for Materials Science

Welcome to the official Github repo for UCSD Course NANO281 - 
"Data Science in Materials Science". Here, you will find the materials for all
lab sessions, as well as useful resources.

# Programming language

All lab sessions will be conducted in Python 3.7+/3.8+. Prior to the labs,
please do the following:

1. Install [python](https://www.python.org/) on your laptop.
2. If you are unfamiliar with Python, please minimally go through the official
   [Python tutorials](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) to
   understand the basics of variable assignment, if and for loops, etc. While
   we are not expecting advanced python knowledge, everything will go much
   quicker if you are already familiar with the basics.

# Course textbooks

The course is intended to be self-contained and all textbooks are optional.
However, the following are useful to have around:

1. The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction,
   Second Edition [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0387848576/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_Z8r8DbR3HMYRE), or get the [free online version](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf).
2. Python Data Science Handbook. Buy from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491912057/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) or get the
